#  Housing Loan Default Risk Analysis

DESCRIPTION

For safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, we have build a machine learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data.

Objective: Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.

Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.

Steps to be done:

* Load the dataset that is given to you
* Check for null values in the dataset
* Print percentage of default to payer of the dataset for the TARGET column
* Balance the dataset
* Plot the balanced data or imbalanced data
* Encode the columns that is required for the model
* Classify as defaulter or not
* Calculate area under receiver operating characteristics curve
